        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Kyle Emler" width="200">
        <p>My name is Kyle Emler. I'm from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. I have a beautiful wife
            named Sarah and sweet 3 year-old princess named Emmie. I work for T-Mobile
            selling their
            new service T-Fiber.
            I've always worked in telecom in some capacity and have really loved helping
            people get
            better internet for less money.
            I served a mission in the Salt Lake City South Mission from 2016-2018 and
            thought I was
            for sure going to move back to Utah and spend the rest of my life there.
            Instead I started pathway in 2018 and met my wife through pathway, she lived in
            the same
            area as me.
            We got married in 2019 and have never wanted to move to Utah.

        <p>Oklahoma is located near the center of the United States, and a key visual cue is
            the
            distinct 'panhandle' that sticks out of the left side of the state.</p>
